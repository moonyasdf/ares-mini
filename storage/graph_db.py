"""
Graph Database Interface for Ares-Mini.

This module provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the knowledge graph
database. It defines a standard interface (`GraphDB`) that can be implemented
by various backend providers (e.g., NetworkX for in-memory graphs, Neo4j for
persistent, enterprise-grade graphs).

This design allows the rest of the application to interact with the graph in a
consistent way, regardless of the underlying storage technology, making the
system more flexible and easier to maintain.
